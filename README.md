This is the Official GitHub repository of **FOREST-GC**: a configurable, GPU-accelerated rendering engine to generate **high-resolution synthetic satellite imagery** of tree plantations, primarily olive trees. It includes precise annotations of tree positions and counts, enabling training and evaluation of deep learning models for **automated tree counting from satellite data**.

This project addresses the critical challenge of limited labeled datasets for agricultural monitoring by enabling **sim-to-real transfer learning** for precise tree counting.

## ‚ú® Features

- Generates **realistic RGB+NIR satellite images** with over 100 configurable parameters.
- Emulates diverse terrain textures, tree distributions, and shadows.
- Supports training of object detection and segmentation models (e.g., YOLO, SAM).
- Provides annotations for supervised learning.
- Python + PyTorch implementation optimized for GPUs.

## üöÄ Installation and usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSIGPRO/albero-system.git
cd albero-system/field_generator
```
In order to launch the image generator, use

    python main.py

The configurations of the generator can be found in `main.py`

The output of the generator is saved in `./outputs`

## üåø Evaluation on Real Data with Synthetic Training

This section presents the predictions of **YOLO** and **SAM** models trained exclusively on synthetic tree data. The results demonstrate how well these models generalize to real forest imagery.

**YOLO Predictions:**  
The YOLO model detects trees accurately in real images:

**SAM Predictions:**  
The SAM model produces high-quality segmentation masks:
